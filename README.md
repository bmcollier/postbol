# PostBOL
A Postmodern Business-Oriented Language

PostBOL is a statically-typed, imperative, asynchronous, literate programming language, designed for use in business systems and API. It takes design cues from COBOL, Javascript, Python and Haskell.

Postbol emphasises:

* Speed of execution
* Readability and ease of use
* Ease of learning
* Array functions over for-loops
* Constants over variables ("assign once")
* Literal, subdividable, data structures
